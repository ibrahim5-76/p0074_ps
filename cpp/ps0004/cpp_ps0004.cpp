/* ps0004 - Give me a number! I'll send back a character.
=========================================================
Write a program that takes a number as input and outputs an equivalent ASCII Character.

- If the inputted data is a zero-value, a character, a letter or a text, print
      "Invalid character/s or zero value!" and exit the program RETURNING 1.

- If the inputted data is a floating number, print
      "Invalid: a floating point number!" and exit the program RETURNING 2.

- If the inputted data is a negative or out-of-range number, print
      "Invalid: number is out of the range!" and exit the program RETURNING 3.

- If the inputted data is a number [32:126], print
      "The character for <PRINT_YOUR_NUMBER_HERE> is <PRINT_THE_EQUIVALENT_CHARACTER_HERE>." and exit the program RETURNING 0.
