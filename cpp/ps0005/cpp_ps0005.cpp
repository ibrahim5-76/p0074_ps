/* ps0005 - very simple calculator.
=========================================================
Write a program that takes 2 numbers as operands and a character + - * / % as an operator and outputs the result.

- If the inputted data is a valid, print
      "(<PRINT_FIRST_OPERAND_HERE>) <PRINT_OPERATOR_HERE> (<PRINT_SECOND_OPERAND_HERE>) = <PRINT_RESULT_HERE>" and exit the program RETURNING 0.

- If the inputted operator is not one of these + - * / %, print
      "Invalid character for operator." and exit the program RETURNING 1.

- If the inputted operator is division / and the second operand (divisor) is 0, print
      "Math Error: cannot divide by 0." and exit the program RETURNING 2.

- If the inputted operator is division / and the 2 operands are 0s, print
      "Infinite number of solutions: (0 / 0) is Undefined Quantity." and exit the program RETURNING 3.

- If the inputted operator is modulo % and at least one of the 2 operands is not integer, print
      "cannot execute modulo operation for floating point numbers." and exit the program RETURNING 4.
